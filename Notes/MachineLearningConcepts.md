## Data Preprocessing

### Splitting Data

### Missing Value

* [Scikit Learn - 4.4 Imputation of missing values](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#impute)

#### Options

* Use the featureâ€™s mean value from all the available data.
* Fill in the unknown with a special value like -1.
* Ignore the instance.
* Use a mean value from similar items.
* Use another machine learning algorithm to predict the value.

### Label Encoding

* [Scikit Learn - 4.9 Transforming the prediction target (y)](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/preprocessing_targets.html#preprocessing-targets)

### Classification Imbalance

To alter the data used to train the classifier to deal with imbalanced classification tasks.

* Oversample: means to duplicate examples
* Undersample: means to delete examples

Scenario

* You want to preserve as much information as possible about the rare case (e.g. Credit card fraud)
    * Keep all of the examples form the positive class
    * Undersample or discard examples form the negative class

Drawback

* Deciding which negaive examples to toss out. (You may throw out examples which contain valuable information)

Solution

1. To pick samples to discard that aren't near the decision boundary
2. Use a hybrid approach of undersampling the negative class and oversampling the positive class

(Oversample the positive class have some approaches)

* Replicate the existing examples
* Add new points similar to the existing points
* Add a data point interpolated between existing data points (can lead to overfitting)

## Model Evaluation

### Classification

#### Accuracy (Error Rate)

* The error rate = the number of misclassified instances / the total number of instances tested.
* Measuring errors this way hides how instances were misclssified.

#### Confusion Matrix

* With a confusion matrix you get a better understanding of the classification errors.
* If the off-diagonal elements are all zero, then you have a perfect classifier

* Construct a confusion matrix: a table about Actual labels vs. Predicted label

#### Precision, Recall Ratio

These metrics that are more useful than error rate when detection of one class is more important than another class.

Consider a two-class problem.
(Confusion matrix with different outcome labeled)

Actual \ Redicted   |+1                 |-1
:------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:
**+1**              |True Positive (TP) |False Negative (FN)
**-1**              |False Positive (FP)|True Negative (TN)

* **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP)
    * Tells us the fraction of records that were positive from the group that the classifier predicted to be positive

* **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN)
    * Measures the fraction of positive examples the classifier got right.
    * Classifiers with a large recall dont have many positive examples classified incorectly.

Summary:

* You can easily construct a classifier that achieves a high measure of recall or precision but not both.
* If you predicted everything to be in the positive class, you'd have perfect recall but poor precision.

#### ROC curve

[Wiki - Receiver operating characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic

* The ROC curve shows how the two rates chnge as the threshold changes
* The ROC curve has two lines, a solid one and a dashed one.
    * The solid line:
        * the leftmost point corresponds to classifying everything as the negative class.
        * the rightmost point corresponds to classifying everything in the positive class.
    * The dashed line:
        * the curve you'd get by randomly guessing.
* The ROC curve can be used to compare classifiers and make cost-versus-benefit decisions.
    * Different classifiers may perform better for different threshold values
* The best classifier would be in upper left as much as possible.
    * This would mean that you had a high true positive rate for a low false positive rate.

**AUC** (Area Under the Curve): A metric to compare different ROC

* The AUC gives an average value of the classifier's performance and doesn't substitute for looking at the curve.
* A perfect classifier would have an AUC of 1.0, and random guessing will give you a 0.5.

### Regression

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### Clustering

#### Within Groups Sum of Squares

* Elbow method

#### Mean Silhouette Coefficient of all samples

#### Calinski and Harabaz score

* Max score => the best number of groups (clustes)

## Fitting and Model Complexity

### Overfitting

### Underfitting

### Generalization

### Regularization

## Reducing Loss

### Learning Rate

### Gradient Descent

## Other Learning Method

### Cost-sensitive Learning

* The different incorrect classification will have different costs.
* This gives more weight to the smaller class, which when training the classifier will allow fewer errors in the smaller class
* There are many ways to include the cost information in classification algorithms
    * AdaBoost
        * Adjust the error weight vector D based on the cost function
    * Naive Bayes
        * Predict the class with the lowest expected cost instead of the class with the highest probability
    * SVM
        * Use different C parameters in the cost function for the different classes

### Lazy Learning

### Incremental Learning (Online Learning)
