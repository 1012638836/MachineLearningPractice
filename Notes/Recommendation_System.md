# Recommendation System

## Collaborative filtering

works by taking a data set of user's data and comparing it to the data of other users

**Item-based or user-based similarity?**

Compared the distance between items is known as item-based similarity.

Compare the distance between users is known as user-based similarity.

The choice depends on how many users you may have or how many items you may have.

(If you have a lot of users, then you'll probably want to go with item-based similarity)
